			<h1> Building</h1>
			<p> DONALD J. GATARZ created the master plans for this structure. A mid-centry modern building for a more than thousand year old practice. Architects from the religion's earlier days could have recieved a decent amount of fame and money for designing churches as large as these. But he is no Donato Bramante. "It is unfortuneate that in this competitive atmosphere some professionals ahve chosen to resort to unethical methods to obtain commissions" <a href="https://usmodernist.org/AIANJ/AIANJ-1973-4.pdf">Gatarz 13:4</a></p> 
			<h1> People </h1>
			<p>AFTER WW2 many families moved to suburban Central Jersey. The influx of white Catholic veterans that settled in the area created the need for larger accommodations. nearly 50 years later parish changed to predominently immigrants from SouthAsia and the Philippines. A community of white veterans turned to be one of the most Asian populated areas in the country with 47.5% of the county identifying as Asian. Community changes intent. The mass and the reason for religion all vary with the parishoners. </p>
			<h1> Land </h1>
			<p>SCHEYECHBI used to be the common name for what is now NJ. It is the land of the Lenni-Lenape peoples. The land's original religion believes in a Great Spiriet eleven lessor Gods. Colonialsim destroyed many remnants of the practice but the Land and the Lenape remember. The Treaty of Easton forced the Indigenous of the time out west to what is now Oklahoma. Today there are still Lenapi in NJ here to celebrate, pray, and remember.</p>
